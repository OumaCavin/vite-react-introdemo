# Introduction

This is a React project bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14+ recommended)
- npm (v7+ required)

### Installation

1. Create the project using Vite:
   ```sh
   npm create vite@latest introdemo -- --template react
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd introdemo
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Development Server

To start the application in development mode:
```sh
npm run dev
```

This will start a local development server. Open your browser and navigate to the provided URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).

### Incremental Development

As you update your codebase, changes will be reflected automatically in the development server, thanks to Vite's fast refresh.

### Building for Production

To generate a production build:
```sh
npm run build
```

### Linting and Formatting

To check and fix linting issues:
```sh
npm run lint
```

### Deployment

Once the project is built, you can deploy the contents of the `dist` folder to your preferred hosting provider.
